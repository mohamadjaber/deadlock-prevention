\begin{abstract}

  We present a sound but incomplete criterion for checking
  deadlock freedom of finite state systems expressed in BIP: a
  component-based framework for the construction of complex
  distributed systems.  Since deciding deadlock-freedom for
  finite-state concurrent systems is PSPACE-complete, our criterion
  gives up completeness in return for tractability of evaluation. Our
  criterion can be evaluated by model-checking subsystems of the
  overall large system. The size of these subsystems depends only on
  the local topology of direct interaction between components, and
  \emph{not} on the number of components in the overall system.

  We present two experiments, in which our method compares favorably
  with existing approaches. For example, in verifying deadlock freedom
  of dining philosphers, our method shows linear increase in
  computation time with the number of philosophers, whereas other
  methods (even those that use abstraction) show super-linear
  increase, due to state-explosion.
