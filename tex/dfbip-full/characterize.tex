A BIP-system $(\B, Q_0)$ is \emph{free of global deadlock} iff,
in every reachable state $s$ of $(B, Q_0)$, some interaction $\act$ is enabled.
Formally, $\fa s \in \rstates{\B,Q_0}, \ex \act : s \enb{\act}{\B}$.
%% A BIP-system $(\B, Q_0)$ is \emph{global deadlock prone} iff there exists a reachable state

\bd[Local Deadlock-freedom]
\label{def:local.deadlock-free}
A BIP-system $(\B, Q_0)$ is \emph{free of local deadlock} iff, 
for every subsystem $(\B', Q'_0)$ of  $(\B, Q_0)$, and every reachable state $s$ of $(\B, Q_0)$,
$(\B', Q'_0)$ has some interaction enabled in state $s \pj \B'$.
Formally:\\

%A BIP-system $(\B, Q_0)$ is \emph{local deadlock prone}  iff there exists a subsystem $(\B', Q'_0)$ of  $(\B, Q_0)$

Proposition~\ref{prop:static:supercycle-is-sufficient} states that the
existence of a supercycle implies a local deadlock: all components in
the supercycle are blocked forever.

Proposition~\ref{prop:static:supercycle-is-necessary} states that the
existence of a supercycle is necessary for a local deadlock to occur:
if a set of components, \emph{considered in isolation}, are blocked,
then there exists a supercycle consisting of exactly those components,
together with the interactions that each component enables.




\subsection{Wait-for graphs}

The wait-for-graph for a state $s$ is a directed bipartite and-or
graph which contains as nodes the atomic components $\B_1, \ldots,
\B_n$, and all the interactions $\gamma$.  Edges in the wait-for-graph
are from a $\B_i$ to all the interactions that $\B_i$ enables (in $s$),
and from an interaction $a$ to all the components that participate in
$a$ and which do not enable it (in $s$).


\bd[Wait-for-graph  $\wfg{\B}{s}$]
\label{def:static:wait-for-graph}
Let $\B = \gamma(\B_1,\dots,\B_n)$ be a BIP composite component, and let
$s = \tpl{s_1,\ldots,s_n}$ be an arbitrary state of $\B$.
The {\em wait-for-graph} $\wfg{\B}{s}$ of $s$ is a directed bipartite and-or graph, where
\begin{nlst1}

\item \label{def:static:wait-for-graph:nodes} the nodes of $\wfg{\B}{s}$ are as follows:
%
   \begin{nlst2}
   \item the and-nodes are the atomic components $\B_i$, $i \in \oneton$,
   \item the or-nodes are the interactions $\act \in \gamma$,
% such that for some  $i \in \oneton$: $B_i \in C_a$ and $s_i \enb{a}{B_i}$  OMIT this
   \end{nlst2}

\item \label{def:static:wait-for-graph:edges-aut-action} 
   there is an edge in $\wfg{\B}{s}$ from $\B_i$ to every node 
   $\act$ such that $\B_i \in \cmps{\act}$ and $s_i(\gd{\act}{i}) = \true$, \ie from $\B_i$ to every interaction
   which $\B_i$ enables in $s_i$,

\item  \label{def:static:wait-for-graph:edges-action-aut}
   there is an edge in $\wfg{\B}{s}$ from $a$ to every 
   $\B_i$ such that $\B_i \in \cmps{\act}$ and $s_i(\gd{\act}{i}) = \false$, \ie from $\act$ to every component
   $\B_i$ which participates in $\act$ but does not enable it, in state $s_i$.
                  
\end{nlst1}
\ed

A component $\B_i$ is an and-node since all of its successor actions (or-nodes) must be disabled for $\B_i$ to be
incapable of executing.  An interaction $\act$ is an or-node since it is disabled if any of its participant components do
not enable it.  An edge (path) in a wait-for-graph is called a wait-for-edge (wait-for-path).  Write $\act \ar \B_i$
($\B_i \ar \act$ respectively) for a wait-for-edge from $\act$ to $\B_i$ ($\B_i$ to $\act$ respectively).  We abuse notation by
writing $e \in \wfg{\B}{s}$ to indicate that $e$ (either $\act \ar \B_i$ or $\B_i
\ar \act$) is an edge in $\wfg{\B}{s}$.  Also $\B_i \ar \act \ar \B'_i \in \wfg{\B}{s}$ for $B_i \ar \act \in \wfg{\B}{s} \land \act \ar B'_i \in
\wfg{\B}{s}$, \ie for a wait-for-path of length 2, and similarly for longer wait-for-paths.

% done in Local Enablement Assumption above
%We assume, in the sequel, that every component $B_i$ always enables at least one interaction, \ie 
%in all reachable states $s$,  $B_i \ar a$ for at least $a$. This prevents pathological situations where a component
%causes a deadlock by disabling every interaction that it participates in.

Consider the dining philosophers system given in Figure~\ref{fig:diningSpectrum}.  Figure~\ref{fig:wfg0} shows its
wait-for-graph in its sole initial state.  Figure~\ref{fig:wfg1} shows the wait-for-graph after execution of $\get_0$.
Edges from components to interactions are shown solid, and edges from interactions to components are shown dashed.

\subsection{Supercycles and deadlock-freedom}

We characterize a deadlock as the existence in the wait-for-graph of a
graph-theoretic construct that we call a {\em supercycle}:

\bd[Supercycle]
\label{def:supercycle}
Let $\B = \gamma(\B_1,\dots,\B_n)$ be a composite component and $s$ be a state of $\B$.
A subgraph $\SC$ of $\wfg{\B}{s}$ is a supercycle in $\wfg{\B}{s}$ if and only if all of the following hold:
\begin{nlst1}
   \item \label{def:supercycle.nonempty} $\SC$ is nonempty, \ie contains at least one node,

   \item \label{def:supercycle.component-blocked} if $\B_i$ is a node in $\SC$, then for all interactions $\act$ such that
there is an edge in $\wfg{\B}{s}$ from $\B_i$ to $\act$:
      \begin{nlst2}
      \item $\act$ is a node in $\SC$, and 
      \item there is an edge in $\SC$ from $\B_i$ to $\act$,
      \end{nlst2}
that is, $\B_i \ar \act \in \wfg{\B}{s}$ implies $\B_i \ar \act \in \SC$,

   \item \label{def:supercycle.action-blocked}  
if $\act$ is a node in $\SC$, then there exists a $\B_j$ such that:
      \begin{nlst2}
      \item $\B_j$  is a node in $\SC$, and
      \item there is an edge from $\act$ to $\B_j$ in $\wfg{\B}{s}$, and
      \item there is an edge from $\act$ to $\B_j$ in $\SC$,
      \end{nlst2}
that is, $\act \in \SC$ implies $\ex \B_j : \act \ar \B_j \in \wfg{\B}{s} \land \act \ar \B_j \in \SC$,

\end{nlst1}
\ed
where $\act \in SC$ means that $\act$ is a node in $\SC$, etc. 
Also, write $SC \sub \wfg{\B}{s}$ when $\SC$ is a subgraph of $\wfg{\B}{s}$.


\bd[Supercycle-free]
\label{def:supercycle-free}
$\wfg{\B}{s}$ is \emph{supercycle-free} iff 
there does not exist a supercycle $\SC$ in $\wfg{\B}{s}$. 
In this case, say that state $s$ is supercycle-free.
Formally, we define the predicate 
    $\scf{B}{s} \df \neg \ex \SC: \SC \sub \wfg{\B}{s} \ \mbox{and $\SC$ is a supercycle}$. 
\ed

\begin{figure*}[ht]
  \begin{center}
   \scalebox{0.4}{\input{figs/wfgDiningCycle.pdf_t}}
   \caption{Example supercycle for dining philosophers system of Figure~\ref{fig:diningSpectrum}.}
   \label{fig:sc}
  \end{center}
\end{figure*}


Figure~\ref{fig:sc} shows an example supercycle (with boldened edges) for the dining philosophers
system of Figure~\ref{fig:diningSpectrum}.
$P_0$ waits for (enables) a single interaction, $\Get_0$. 
$\Get_0$ waits for (is disabled by) fork $F_0$, which waits for interaction $\Rel_0$.
$\Rel_0$ in turn waits for $P_0$. However, this supercycle occurs in a state where $P_0$ is in $h$
and $F_0$ is in $u_l$. This state is not reachable from the initial state. 



Figure~\ref{fig:cycleOK} shows an ``abstract'' example, where these is
a cycle of wait-for-edges, without there being a supercycle.This shows
that a cycle does not necessarily imply a supercycle, and hence
deadlock. Adding a wait-for-edge from $d$ to $\B_1$ would create a
supercycle in Figure~\ref{fig:cycleOK}.

\end{figure}






The existence of a supercycle is sufficient and necessary for the occurrence of
a deadlock, and so checking for supercycles gives a sound and complete check for
deadlocks.  
%
Proposition~\ref{prop:static:supercycle-is-sufficient} states that the
existence of a supercycle implies a local deadlock: all components in
the supercycle are blocked forever.

\bp
\label{prop:static:supercycle-is-sufficient}
Let $s$ be a state of $\B$.
If $\SC \sub \wfg{\B}{s}$ is a supercycle, then all components $\B_i$ in $\SC$ cannot execute a transition in any state reachable
from $s$, including $s$ itself.
\ep
%\begin{proof}
\prfs{Every interaction $\act$ that $\B_i$ enables is not enabled by some
participant. By Defintion~\ref{def.bip.enablement}, $\act$ cannot be
executed. Hence $\B_i$ cannot execute any transition.
}
%
\prf{
Let $\B_i$ be an arbitrary component in $SC$. By Definition~\ref{def:supercycle}, every interaction that $\B_i$ enables
has a wait-for-edge to some other component $\B_j$ in $\SC$ and so cannot be executed in state $s$. Hence in any
transition from $s$ to another global state $t$, all of the components $\B_i$ in $\SC$ remain in the same local state. 
Hence $\SC \sub \wfg{\B}{t}$, \ie the same supercycle $\SC$ remains in global state $t$. Repeating this argument from state $t$
and onwards leads us to conclude that $\SC \sub \wfg{\B}{u}$ for any state $u$ reachable from $s$.
}%\end{proof}

Proposition~\ref{prop:static:supercycle-is-necessary} states that the
existence of a supercycle is necessary for a local deadlock to occur:
if a set of components, \emph{considered in isolation}, are blocked,
then there exists a supercycle consisting of exactly those components,
together with the interactions that each component enables.
%
\bp
\label{prop:static:supercycle-is-necessary} 
\label{prop:supercycle-is-necessary}
Let $\B'$ be a subcomponent of $\B$, and
let $s$ be an arbitrary state of $\B$ such that $\B'$,
when considered in isolation, has no enabled interaction in state $s \pj \B'$.
%
Then, $\wfg{\B}{s}$ contains a supercycle.
\ep
\prfs{Every atomic component $\B_i$ in $\B'$ is individually deadlock free, by assumption, 
and so there is at least one interaction $a_i$ which
$\B_i$ enables. Now $a_i$ is not enabled in $\B'$, by the antecedent of the proposition. Hence $a_i$ has some
outgoing wait-for-edge in $\wfg{\B}{s}$. The subgraph of $\wfg{\B}{s}$ induced by all
the $\B_i$ and all their (locally) enabled interactions is therefore a supercycle.
}
%
\prf{Let $\B_i$ be an arbitrary atomic component in $\B'$, and let $\act_i$ be any interaction that $\B_i$ enables. Since $\B'$ has no
enabled interaction, it follows that $\act_i$ is not enabled in $\B'$, and
therefore has a wait-for-edge to some atomic component $\B_j$ in
$\B'$. Let $SC$ be the subgraph of $\wfg{\B}{s}$ induced by:
\bn
\item the atomic components of $\B'$, 
\item the interactions $\act$ that each atomic component $\B_i$ enables,
     and the edges $\B_i \ar \act$, and
\item  the edges $\act \ar \B_j$ from each interaction to some atomic
     component $\B_j$ in $\B'$ that does not enable $\B_j$.
\en
$\SC$ satisfies Definition~\ref {def:supercycle} and so is a supercycle.
}

We consider subcomponent $\B'$ in isolation to avoid other phenomena that prevent interactions from executing, \eg
conspiracies \cite{AFG93}.  
Now the converse of Proposition~\ref{prop:supercycle-is-necessary} is that absence of
supercycles in $\wfg{\B}{s}$ means there is no locally deadlocked subsystem. 



\bco[Supercycle-free implies free of local deadlock]
\label{cor:static:dead-free}
%Let $(B,Q_0)$ be a BIP system, with $B = \gamma(\B_1,\dots,\B_n)$. 
If, for every reachable state $s$ of $(\B,Q_0)$, $\wfg{\B}{s}$ is supercycle-free, then
$(\B,Q_0)$ is free of local deadlock.
\eco
%
\prf{
We establish the contrapositive.
Suppose that $(\B, Q_0)$ is not free of local deadlock. Then there exists a subsystem $(\B', Q'_0)$ of $(\B, Q_0)$, and
a reachable state $s$ of $(\B', Q'_0)$, such that $\B'$ enables no interaction in state  $s \pj \B'$.
By Proposition~\ref{prop:supercycle-is-necessary}, $\wfg{\B}{s}$ contains a supercycle.
}

In the sequel, we wil say ``deadlock-free'' to mean ``free of local deadlock''.



\subsection{Structural properties of supercycles}

We present some structural properties of supercycles, which
are central to our deadlock-freedom conditions.


\bd[Path, path length] \label{def:path}
Let $G$ be a directed graph and $v$ a vertex in $G$. A path $\pi$ in $G$ is a \emph{finite} sequence
$v_0, v_1, \ldots,v_n$ such that $(v_i, v_{i+1})$ is an edge in $G$ for all $i \in \rng{0}{n-1}$.
Write $\pth{G}{\pi}$ iff $\pi$ is a path in $G$.
Define $\first{\pi} = v_0$ and $\last{\pi} = v_n$. 
%
Let $|\pi|$ denote the length of $\pi$, which we define as follows:
\be
\item if $\pi$ is simple, \ie all $v_i$, $0 \le i \le n$, are distinct, then $|\pi| = n$, \ie the
number of edges in $\pi$
\item if $\pi$ contains a cycle, \ie there exist $v_i, v_j$ such that $i \ne j$ and $v_i = v_j$, then
$|\pi| = \omega$ ($\omega$ for ``infinity'').
\ee

\ed

\bd[In-depth, Out-depth] \label{def:depth} 
Let $G$ be a directed graph and $v$ a vertex in $G$. Define the in-depth of $v$ in $G$, notated as
$\idepth{G}{v}$, as follows:
\be
\item if there exists a path $\pi$ in $G$ that contains a cycle and ends in $v$, \ie $|\pi| = \omega
  \land \last{\pi} = v$, then $\idepth{G}{v} = \omega$,
%THIS DEFINITION OF INFINITE IN-DEGREEE IS STRANGE, SINCE YOU HAVE ``INFINITE' PATHS THAT NEVERTHELESS END IN A NODE!

\item otherwise, let $\pi$ be a longest (simple) path ending in $v$. Then $\idepth{G}{v} = |\pi|$.
\ee
Formally, $\idepth{G}{v} = (\MAX\ \pi : \pth{G}{\pi} \land \last{\pi} = v : |\pi|)$.

Likewise define the out-depth of $v$ in $G$, notated as
$\odepth{G}{v}$, as follows:
\be
\item if there exists a path $\pi$ in $G$ that contains a cycle and starts in $v$, \ie $|\pi| = \omega
  \land \first{\pi} = v$, then $\odepth{G}{v} = \omega$,

\item otherwise, let $\pi$ be a longest (simple) path starting in $v$. Then $\odepth{G}{v} = |\pi|$.
\ee
Formally, $\odepth{G}{v} = (\MAX\ \pi : \pth{G}{\pi} \land \first{\pi} = v : |\pi|)$.
\ed

\noindent
We use $\widepth{\B}{v}{s}$ for $\idepth{\wfg{\B}{s}}{v}$, and also
$\wodepth{\B}{v}{s}$ for $\odepth{\wfg{\B}{s}}{v}$.


\bp \label{prop:supercycle:finite-indepth-not-essential} Let $\SC$ be
a supercycle and let $\SC'$ result from removing all nodes in $\SC$ with
finite in-depth. Then $\SC'$ is also a supercycle.
\ep
\prf{
Proof is by induction on the in-depth $i$ of nodes in $\SC$.

Base case: in-depth = 0. Let $\SC'$ be the result of removing all nodes of in-depth 0 from $SC$. Since no node waits
for a node of in-depth 0, it follows that a node of in-depth 0 does not contribute to the satisfaction of
Definition~\ref{def:supercycle}, and hance $\SC'$ is still a supercycle.

Inductive step: in-depth = $i$: let $\SC"$ be the result of removing all nodes of in-depth $i-1$ from $SC$.
By the induction hypothesis, $\SC"$ is a supercycle. Now let $\SC'$ be the result of 
removing, from $\SC"$, all nodes that have in-depth $i$ in $SC$.
Now all nodes of in-depth $i$ in $\SC$ have an in-depth of 0 in
$\SC"$. Hence removing all such nodes from $\SC"$ results, by the same argument as for the base case, 
in a supercyle $\SC'$.



}



\bp \label{prop:supercycle:no-finite-outdegree}
\label{prop:supercycle:no-finite-outdepth} A supercycle $SC$
contains no nodes with finite out-depth.
\ep
%
\prfs{By contradiction. Let $v$ be a node in $\SC$ with finite out-depth.
Hence all outgoing paths from $v$ end in a
sink node. By assumption, all atomic components are individually
deadlock-free, \ie they always enable at least one interaction. Hence
these sink nodes are all interactions, and therefore they violate
clause~\ref{clause:supercycle:action-blocked} in Definition~\ref{def:supercycle}.
}
%
\prf{By contradiction. Let $v$ be a node in $\SC$ with finite out-depth.
Hence by Definition~\ref{def:depth}  all outgoing paths from $v$ are
simple (and finite), and end in a
sink node $w$, so $w$ has no outgoing wait-for-edges.
By assumption, all atomic components are individually
deadlock-free, \ie they always enable at least one interaction. So if
$w$ is an atomic component $\B_i$, we have a wait-for-edge $\B_i \ar \act$
for some interaction $\act$, contradicting the fact that $w$ is a sink node.
Hence $w$ is some interaction $\act$.
Since $\act$ has no outgoing edges, it violates
clause~\ref{def:supercycle.action-blocked} in
Definition~\ref{def:supercycle}, contradicting the assumption that
$\SC$ is a supercycle.
}


% The next two results concern the structure of supercycle. The first
% shows that a supercycle contains at least one strongly connected
% component. The second shows that removing nodes with only simple paths
% leading into them leaves a resulting graph that is also a supercycle,
% \ie that such nodes are not ``essential'' elements of a
% supercycle. This idea is central to our deadlock-freedom condition.

\bp \label{prop:supercycle:contains-twoNodes}
Every supercycle $\SC$ contains at least two nodes.
\ep
\prf{
By Definition~\ref{def:supercycle}, $\SC$ is nonempty, and so contains at least one node $v$.
If $v$ is an interaction $\act$, then by Definition~\ref{def:supercycle}, $\SC$ also contains some component $\B_i$ such that 
$\act \ar \B_i$. 
If $v$ is a  component $\B_i$, then, by assumption, $\B_i$ enables at least one interaction $\act$, and by 
Definition~\ref{def:supercycle}, every interaction that $\B_i$ enables must be in $\SC$.
Hence in both cases, $\SC$ contains at least two nodes.
}


\bp \label{prop:supercycle:contains-cycle}
Every supercycle $\SC$ contains at least one cycle.
\ep
%
\prfs{Suppose not. Then $\SC$ is an acyclic supercycle. Hence every node in $\SC$
 has finite out-depth, which contradicts
 Proposition~\ref{prop:supercycle:no-finite-outdegree}. }
%
\prf{By contradiction. Suppose that $\SC$ is a supercycle and is also
  acyclic. Then every path in $\SC$ is simple, and therefore finite.
  Hence every node in $\SC$ has finite out-depth. By
  Proposition~\ref{prop:supercycle:no-finite-outdegree}, $\SC$ cannot
  be a supercycle.}



\bp \label{prop:supercycle:essential-subgraph-of} Let $\B =
\gamma(\B_1,\dots,\B_n)$ be a composite component and $s$ a state of
$\B$.  Let $SC$ be a supercycle in $\wfg{\B}{s}$, and let $SC'$ be the
graph obtained from $SC$ by removing all vertices of finite in-depth
and their incident edges. Then $SC'$ is also a supercycle in
$\wfg{\B}{s}$.  \ep
%
\prfs{
By Proposition~\ref{prop:supercycle:contains-cycle}, $\SC'$ is nonempty.
Thus $SC'$ satisfies clause (1) of Definition~\ref{def:supercycle}.
%
Let $v$ be an arbitrary vertex of $\SC'$. Hence $v$ has infinite in-depth, and
therefore so do all of $v$'s sucessors in $\SC$. Hence all of these successors
are in $\SC'$. 
Hence every vertex $v$ in $SC'$ has successors
in $\SC'$ that satisfy clauses (2) and (3) of Definition~\ref{def:supercycle}.
}
%
\prf{
A vertex with finite in-depth cannot lie on a cycle in $\SC$.  Hence
by Proposition~\ref{prop:supercycle:contains-cycle}, $\SC' \neq
\emptyset$. Thus $\SC'$ satisfies clause (1) of the supercycle
definition~(\ref{def:supercycle}).
%
Let $v$ be an arbitrary vertex of $\SC'$.  Thus $v \in \SC$ and $\idepth{\SC}{v} = \omega$ by definition of $SC'$. Let
$w$ be an arbitrary successor of $v$ in $\SC$. $\idepth{\SC}{w} = \omega$ by Definition~\ref{def:depth}. Hence
$w \in \SC'$, by definition of $SC'$.  Furthermore, $w$ is a successor of $v$ in $\SC'$, since $SC'$ consists of
\emph{all} nodes of $SC$ with infinite in-depth. Hence the successors of $v$ in $\SC'$ are
the same as the successors of $v$ in $\SC$
%
%Thus every vertex $v$ of $\SC'$ is also a vertex of $\SC$, and 
%
Now since $\SC$ is a supercycle, every vertex $v$ in $\SC$ has enough successors in $\SC$ to satisfy clauses (2) and (3)
of the supercycle definition~(\ref{def:supercycle}). It follows that every vertex $v$ in $\SC'$ has enough successors in
$\SC'$ to satisfy clauses (2) and (3) of the supercycle definition~(\ref{def:supercycle}).  }


\bp \label{prop:supercycle:contains-mssc}
Every supercycle $\SC$ contains a maximal strongly connected component $\CC$
such that (1) $\CC$ is itself a supercycle, and (2) there is no wait-for-edge from a node in $\CC$ to a node outside of $\CC$.
\ep
%
\prf{
$\SC$ is a directed graph, and so consider the decomposition of $\SC$
into its maximal strongly connected components (MSCC). Let $\overline{\SC}$ be the graph resulting
from replacing each MSCC by a single node. By its construction,  $\overline{\SC}$ is acyclic, and so contains at least one
node $x$ with no outgoing edges. Let $\CC$ be the MSCC corresponding to $x$. It follows that $\CC$ is nonempty, and
hence $\CC$ satisfies clause (1) of the supercycle definition~(\ref{def:supercycle}).
It also follows from the construction of $\CC$ that no node in $\CC$ has a wait-for-edge going to a node outside of
$\CC$, and so Clause (2) of the Proposition is established.

Let $v$ be an arbitrary node in $\CC$. Since $\CC \sub \SC$, $v$ is a node of $\SC$. Let $w$ be an arbitrary successor of
$v$ in $\SC$. Since no node in $\CC$ has an edge going to a node outside of $\CC$, it follows that $w$ is a node of $\CC$.
Hence $v$ has the same successors in $\CC$ as in $\SC$. 
Now since $\SC$ is a supercycle, every vertex $v$ in $\SC$ has enough successors in $\SC$ to satisfy clauses (2) and (3)
of the supercycle definition~(\ref{def:supercycle}). It follows that every vertex $v$ in $\CC$ has enough successors in
$\CC$ to satisfy clauses (2) and (3) of the supercycle definition~(\ref{def:supercycle}).  

Hence, by Definition~\ref{def:supercycle}, $\CC$ is itself a supercycle, and so Clause (1) of the Proposition is established.
}

Note also that by Proposition~\ref{prop:supercycle:contains-twoNodes}, $\CC$ contains at least two nodes. Hence $\CC$ is
not a trivial strongly connected component.





\subsection{Membership constraints for supercycles}

Define $\scyc{\B}{s}{\B_i}$, $\scyc{\B}{s}{\act}$ to mean that $\B_i$,
$\act$, respectively, are nodes of a supercycle of $\wfg{\B}{s}$.
If a component or interaction is not a node of a supercylcle, then we say that it has an 
\emph{SC-violation}.

Definition~\ref{def:supercycle}, the definition of a supercycle, imposes certain contraints on membership of
supercycles, for a given apttern of wait-for-edges. We outline these as follows:
\bn

\item If a component $\B_i$ has an interaction $\act$ such that $\B_i \ar \act \in \wfg{\B}{t}$ and
  $\act$ has a supercycle violation, then $\act$ cannot be part of a supercycle, and therefore
  neither can $\B_i$, by Definition~\ref{def:supercycle},
  Clause~\ref{def:supercycle.component-blocked}.  Formally, if $\B_i \ar \act \in \wfg{\B}{s}$ then
  $\neg \scyc{\B}{s}{\act} \imp \neg \scyc{\B}{s}{\B_i}$.

\item If a component $\B_i$ has an interaction $\act$ such that $\act \ar \B_i \in \wfg{\B}{t}$ and
  $\act$ has a supercycle violation, then $\act$ cannot be part of a supercycle, and therefore
  neither can $\B_i$, by Definition~\ref{def:supercycle},
  Clause~\ref{def:supercycle.action-blocked}, since if $B_i$ were in a supercycle, then $\act$ would
  be too.
Formally, if $\act \ar \B_i \in \wfg{\B}{s}$ then $\scyc{\B}{s}{\B_i} \imp \scyc{\B}{s}{\act}$, and so $\neg \scyc{\B}{s}{\act} \imp \neg \scyc{\B}{s}{\B_i}$.

\en

From Clauses 1 and 2, we conclude that $\B_i$ has an SC-violation if 
$\ex \act: \B_i \ar \act \in \wfg{\B}{s} \lor \act \ar \B_i \in \wfg{\B}{s}$ and $\act$ has an SC-violation.

In some, but not all, cases, we gain some information by considering all the interactions (components) that a component
(action) waits for:

\bn

%\item If, for an interaction $\act$, all components $\B_i$ such that $\act \ar \B_i \in \wfg{\B}{t}$ have a supercycle 
%  violation, then all such components $\B_i$ cannot be part of a supercycle, and therefore neither can $\act$, 
\item For a given interaction $\act$, let $\B_i,\ldots,B_j$ be all the components $B$ such that $\act \ar
  B \in \wfg{\B}{s}$.  Then 
 $\scyc{\B}{s}{\act} \imp (\ex B \in \B_i,\ldots,B_j: \scyc{\B}{s}{\B_i})$, by 
  Definition~\ref{def:supercycle}, Clause~\ref{def:supercycle.action-blocked}.
  So $\act$ is in a supercycle implies that some $B \in \B_i,\ldots,B_j$ is
  in a supercycle.  Taking the contrapositive, $(\fa B \in \B_i,\ldots,B_j: \neg \scyc{\B}{s}{\B_i})
  \imp \neg \scyc{\B}{s}{\act}$.  Thus, if no component that $\act$ waits for is in a supercycle,
  then $\act$ cannot be in a supercycle.

\item For a given interaction $\act$, let $\B_i,\ldots,B_j$ be all the components $B$ such that $B \ar \act \in \wfg{\B}{s}$.
Then $\neg \scyc{\B}{s}{\act} \imp (\fa B \in \B_i,\ldots,B_j: \neg \scyc{\B}{s}{\B_i})$.
So $\act$ has an SC-violation implies that $\fa B \in \B_i,\ldots,B_j:$ $B$ has an SC-violation.
This can be seen as a repetitive application of Clause 1 of the previous list, and so it provides no new information.

\item For a given component $\B_i$, let $\act_1,\ldots, \act_m$ be all the interactions $\act$ such that $\B_i \ar \act \in \wfg{\B}{s}$.
Then $\neg \scyc{\B}{s}{\B_i} \imp (\ex \act \in \act_1,\ldots,\act_m: \neg \scyc{\B}{s}{\act})$.
The $\B_i$ has an SC-violation implies that some $\act$ has an SC-violation. This is not useful, since it does not
determine the particular $\act$ with the violation. Hence this observation will not play a role in our future development.

\item For a given component $\B_i$, let $\act_1,\ldots, \act_m$ be all the interactions $\act$ such that $\act \ar \B_i \in \wfg{\B}{s}$.
Then $\scyc{\B}{s}{\B_i} \imp (\fa \act \in \act_1,\ldots,\act_m: \scyc{\B}{s}{\act})$.
Hence $(\ex \act \in \act_1,\ldots,\act_m: \neg \scyc{\B}{s}{\act}) \imp \neg \scyc{\B}{s}{\B_i}$.
Thus $\B_i$ has an SC-violation if some $\act$ that waits for $\B_i$ has an SC-violation.
This can be seen as a repetitive application of Clause 2 of the previous list, and so it provides no new information.

\en
Hence from the above 4 clauses, only clause 1 provides new information. 
Combining clauses 1 and 2 from the first list, and clause 1 from the second list, we obtain.

%\subsection{Membership constraints for strongly-connected supercycles}
%Define $\scscyc{\B}{s}{\B_i}$, $\scscyc{\B}{s}{\act}$ to mean that $\B_i$,
%$\act$, respectively, are nodes of a strongly-connected supercycle of $\wfg{\B}{s}$.

%\item If, for a node $v$ (either component or interaction), all incoming wait-for-edges are from nodes with a supercycle
%  violation, then $v$ cannot be in a \emph{strongly connected} supercycle, since all of its predecessors are not in a
%  strongly connected supercycle.
