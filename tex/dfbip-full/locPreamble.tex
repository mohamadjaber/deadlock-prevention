Evaluating the global restrictions $\GAO(B,Q_0,\act)$, $\GLin(B,Q_0,\act)$ requires checking all reachable transitions of
$(\B, Q_0)$, which is, in general, subject to state-explosion.
We need restrictions which imply a global restriction, and 
and which can be checked efficiently.
%
To this end, we first develop some terminology, and a projection result, for relating the waiting-behavior in a
subsystem of $(B,Q_0)$ to that in $(B,Q_0)$ overall.
