Dear all,

Attached please find a draft journal version of our FORTE
deadlock-freedom paper from last year. I have generalized the
condition for deadlock freedom so that it takes into account
"branching", ie the possibility for choice of enabled actions in a
component. I think this will make the condition much more general, and
we will have less "false negatives".

Of course we need to implement the new algorithm and run experiments. 
Please read the draft, and please suggest examples and case
studies to try the new algorithm on. Cheers,

Paul


PS. the abstract, intro and conclusions are the same as the FORTE
paper. Mainly please read the new definitions, the new conditions for
deadlock freedom (GALT, LALT) and the new algorithm for computing LALT
