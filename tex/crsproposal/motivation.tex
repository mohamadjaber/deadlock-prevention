\section{Motivation and Background}

Consider the committee coordination problem described by Chandy and Misra~\cite{MisraCommittee}. 

\begin{quote}
  Professors in a certain university
  have organized themselves into committees.
  Each committee has an unchanging membership
  roster of one or more professors. From
  time to time, a professor may decide to attend
  a committee meeting; it starts waiting
  and remains waiting until a meeting of a committee
  of which it is a member is started.
  The restrictions on meetings are as follows:
  (1) a committee meeting may be started only
  if all members of that committee are waiting
  and (2) no two committees may meet simultaneously
  if they have a common member. 
  Given that all meetings terminate in finite
  time, the problem is to devise a protocol,
  satisfying these restrictions, that also guarantees
  that if all members of a committee are
  waiting then at least one of them will attend
  some meeting.
\end{quote}

A deadlock may arise when professors 

Our proposed work aims to address all of the mentioned gaps.
