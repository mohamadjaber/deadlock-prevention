\section{Timeline}

Our proposed timeline is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Formulation of theory of supercycles and the algorithm for
  computing our deadlock-freedom check (work in progress)

\item Implementation of the deadlock-freedom check and use of the
  implementation for experiments, beyond the preliminary work reported above

\item Use of feedback from theexperiments to refine the theory, and to
  improve the accuracy ofthe deadlock0freedom check

\item Extensons of the theory ..

\item 
\end{enumerate}
