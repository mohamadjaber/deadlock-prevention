\section{Timeline}
In addition to having proposed the above work, all four PIs will be directly involved in monitoring
all phases of it. More specifically, they will monitor closely the assisting graduate students in all the specified targets. The proposed project also requires weekly revisions of formalization, modeling, design, implementations, and measurement. In the following, you will find the time-line of the project. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Data collection, cleaning, modeling:  3 months, to be undertaken by Lead PI, PI in Computer Science and PI in Linguistics.
\item Machine learning for detecting bias: 3 months to be undertaken by all four PIs in equal shares.
\item Machine learning for detecting dishonest news: 3 months to be undertaken by all PIs in equal shares.
\item Visualisation and mapping: 2 months to be undertaken by the two PIs in computer science.
\item Online streaming is an ongoing process that spans across all phases above.
\end{enumerate}
