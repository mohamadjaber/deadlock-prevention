\section{Timeline}

In addition to having proposed the above work, all four PIs will be
directly involved in monitoring all phases of it. More specifically,
they will monitor closely the assisting graduate students in all the
specified targets. The proposed project also requires weekly revisions
of formalization, modeling, design, implementations, and
measurement. In the following, you will find the time-line of the
project.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Formulation of theory of supercycles and the algorithm for
  computing our deadlock-freedom check (work in progress)

\item Implementation of the deadlock-freedom check and use of the
  implementation for experiments, beyond the preliminary work reported above

\item Use of feedback from theexperiments to refine the theory, and to
  improve the accuracy ofthe deadlock0freedom check

\item Extensons of the theory ..

\item 
\end{enumerate}
