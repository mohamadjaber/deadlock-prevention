\section{Budget}

The budget is detailed according to more accurate 
AUB estimates of labor and equipment cost in the online
submission. 

The PIs will partially rely on the help of one PhD student and 
two Masters students supported with a part time RA
to undertake the proposed work.

We will also need a dedicated server with strong parallel 
processing abilities to perform the development and
the benchmarking of our method.
