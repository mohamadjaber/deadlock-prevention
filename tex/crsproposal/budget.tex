\section{Budget}

The PIs will rely on the help of research assistants with regards to the technical aspects of each phase of the project -- primarily, skills related to code development and running experiments. We expect to require the help of two RAs to assist in building the infrastructure for data collection and online streaming on the Hadoop cluster, one RA to assist in the Natural Language processing phase, and one RA to assist with the Machine Learning phase. We propose to remunerate each RA at a rate of $\$500$ a month, for the duration of 12 months. We also request about $\$4000$ to account for the costs for setting up a Hadoop cluster in the Amazon cloud or Microsoft Azure, where online streaming and analytics will take place. Finally, we request $\$300$ for general office supplies. Our total thus requested is
\[
(\$500*4*12) + \$4000 + \$300 = \$ 28,3000
