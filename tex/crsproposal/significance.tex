\section{Significance of the Project}

Below we elaborate on several aspects behind the significance of the proposed work:


\subsection{Novelty of the proposal}

Our work presents the first theoretically complete characterization of deadlock
in distributed systems where each component has a local choice of actions.
Despite the deadlock problem being extensively studied for several decades \cite{Kn87}
out work is the first to supply a sound and complete characterization of
deadlock in concurrent programs with nondeterministic choice of actions.

Our work is also one of the first to use the idea of \emph{projecting a global condition
onto a small subsystem} in order to obtain a sound (but incomplete) condition
which can be evaluated quickly, and which guarantees deadlock freedom in case it
evaluates to true.



\subsection{Importance of the project's interdisciplinary aspects}

From an application point of view, 
deadlock-freedom is an issue in any large distributed software system, and such
systems pervade almost every discipline. Examples are the internet itself, the
world wide web, stock trading systems, banking systems, medical information
systems, etc.
Deadlock freedom is also an issue in complex hardware system, \eg
instruction pipelines in modern CPU's are subject to locking, which is a hardware
form of deadlock.

From a theoretical and foundational point of view, the analysis of deadlock
freedom requires methods from both theoretical computer science (modeling of
distributed systems as automata and state-transition systems) and also from
applied logic, to evaluate the deadlock freedom checks, and to construct
suitable abstractions for extending the current work.




\subsection{Expected impact of the project's outcomes}

We will implement our method and place our implementation on the web
for download. We expect that others will utilize our work to check deadlock
freedom of systems that they are developing. In addition, our approach can
potentially be merged with the work of others \cite{AGR16} on deadlock freedom, to create
even more powerful methods for checking deadlock freedom.



\subsection{Dissemination plan of results}

As stated above, we will make our implementation of our method publicly
available for others to use. We are currently writing a draft journal paper
which presents our current work. If funded, this proposal will lead to a second
paper which will describe the work proposed here, together with the results.


\subsection{Project's relevance at the local, regional, and international levels}

Most large software systems contain multiple interacting components which
execute concurrently, and so are therefore subject to deadlock. Lebanon has a
local IT industry which implements software. Awareness of our work would help
software designers avoid the problem of deadlock in the systems that they build.
