\subsection{The supercycle formation condition}

We use the structural properties of supercycles (\secn{supercycle-structural}) and the dynamics of wait-for graphs (\prop{wait-for-edge-preservation})
to define a condition that must hold whenever a supercycle is created. Negating this condition then implies the absence of supercycles.


\begin{proposition}[Supercycle formation condition] \label{prop:supercycle-formation}
Assume that $s \goesto[\act] t$ is a transition of $(\B, Q_0)$, $\wfg{\B}{s}$ is supercycle-free, and that $\wfg{\B}{t}$
contains a supercycle.  Then, in $\wfg{\B}{t}$, there exists a $\CC$ such that
\bn
\item $\CC$ is a subgraph of $\wfg{\B}{t}$, \ie $\CC \subg \wfg{\B}{t}$
\item $\CC$ is strongly connected
\item $\CC$ is a supercycle
\item  in $\wfg{\B}{t}$, there is no wait-for edge from a node in $\CC$ to a node outside of $\CC$
\item there exists a component $\B_i \in \cmps{\act}$ such that $\B_i$ is in $\CC$
\en
\end{proposition}
%
\begin{proof}
  By assumption, there is a supercycle $\SC$ that is a subgraph of $\wfg{\B}{t}$.  By Proposition~\ref{prop:supercycle:contains-mssc}, $\SC$ contains
  a subgraph $\CC$ that is strongly connected, is itself a supercycle, and such that there is no wait-for-edge from a node in $\CC$ to a node outside
  of $\CC$.  This establishes Clauses~1--4.

Now suppose $\B_i \not\in \CC$ for every $\B_i \in \cmps{\act}$. Then, no edge in $\CC$ is
$\B_i$-incident.  Hence, by Proposition~\ref{prop:wait-for-edge-preservation}, every edge in $\CC$
is an edge in $\wfg{\B}{s}$. Hence $\CC$ is a subgraph of $\wfg{\B}{s}$.
%
Now let $v$ be an arbitrary node in $\CC$.
%
Suppose $v$ is a component $\B_j$.  By assumption, $\B_j \not\in \cmps{\act}$, and so
$s \pj \B_j = t \pj \B_j$ by Definition~\ref{def.bip.composition}. Hence $\B_j$ enables the same set
of interactions in state $s$ as in state $t$. Also, in $\wfg{\B}{t}$, all of $\B_j$'s wait-for edges
must end in an interaction that is in $\CC$, since $\CC$ is a supercycle in $\wfg{\B}{t}$. Hence the
same holds in $\wfg{\B}{s}$.
%
If $v$ is an interaction, it must also have a wait-for-edge $e'$ to some component $\B_j \in \CC$,
since $\CC$ is a supercycle in $\wfg{\B}{t}$. Hence this also holds in $\wfg{\B}{s}$.
%
Hence $v$ has enough successors in $\CC$ to satisfy the supercycle definition (\defn{supercycle}).
%
We conclude that $\CC$ by itself is a supercycle in $\wfg{\B}{s}$, which contradicts the assumption
that $\wfg{\B}{s}$ is supercycle-free. Hence, $\B_i \in \CC$ for some $\B_i \in \cmps{\act}$, and so
Clause~5 is established.  
\end {proof}


%% overview of the four criteria: intrroduce strong connectedness violation

The supercycle formation condition (Proposition~\ref{prop:supercycle-formation}) tells us that, when a supercycle $\SC$ is created, some component
$\B_i$ that participates in the interaction $\act$ whose execution created $\SC$, must be a node of a strongly connected component $\CC$ of $\SC$, and
moreover $\CC$ is itself a supercycle in its own right. In a sense, $\CC$ is the ``essential'' part of $\SC$.  We use this to formulate a condition
that prevents the formation of supercycles. For transition $s \goesto[\act] t$, we determine for every component $\B_i \in \cmps{\act}$ whether it is
possible for $\B_i$ to be a node in a strongly-connected supercycle $\CC$ in $\wfg{\B}{t}$.  There are two ways for $\B_i$ to not be a node in a
strongly-connected supercycle: 
%
\bn
\item \label{conditions:no-sc-member}   \textit{no supercycle membership}: $\B_i$ is not a node of any supercycle, \ie $\neg \scyc{\B}{s}{\B_i}$.
\item  \label{conditions:no-strongly-connected} \textit{no strong-connectedness}: $\B_i$ is a node in a supercycle, but not a node in a \emph{strongly-connected} supercycle. 
\en
%
Hence, for a BIP system $(\B, Q_0)$, our fundamental criterion for the prevention of supercycles is that, for every reachable transition
$s \goesto[\act] t$ resulting from execution of $\act$, in the resulting state $t$, every component $\B_i$ of $\act$ must violate at least one of the
above two conditions.  Condition~(\ref{conditions:no-sc-member}) is just supercycle violation, as in \defn{supercycle.violation}.
Condition~(\ref{conditions:no-strongly-connected}) is violation with respect to a strongly connnected supercycle, \ie non-membership in a strongly
connected supercycle. Technically, this is implied by supercycle violation, and so the disjunction of the two conditions is equivalent to 
Condition~(\ref{conditions:no-sc-member}). It is however, convenient to use the disjunction of the two conditions, since
we will formulate local versions of these violation conditions, and the implication does not necessarily hold for the local versions.

For a given BIP system $(\B, Q_0)$ and interaction $\act$, we use $\GAO(\B, Q_0, \act)$ to denote the deadlock-freedom criterion based on the
disjunction of Conditions~(\ref{conditions:no-sc-member}) and (\ref{conditions:no-strongly-connected}) above. 
This criterion is, in a sense, the ``most general'' criterion for supercycle-freedom.
%
If $\GAO(\B, Q_0, \act)$ holds, and global state $s$ is supercycle-free, and $s \goesto[\act] t$, then it follows (as we establish below) that global
state $t$ is also supercycle-free.  So, by requiring (1) that all initial states are supercycle-free, and (2) that $\GAO(\B, Q_0, \act)$ holds for all
interactions $\act \in \gamma$, we obtain, by straightforward induction on length of executions, that every reachable state is supercycle-free.

It also follows that any condition which implies $\GAO(\B, Q_0, \act)$ is also sufficient to guarantee  supercycle-freedom, and
hence deadlock-freedom. We exploit this in two ways:
\bn

\item To define a ``linear'' condition, $\GLin$, that is easier to evaluate than $\GAO$, since it requires only the
evaluation of lengths of wait-for-paths, \ie it does not have the ``alternating'' character of $\GAO$.  It also implies $\GAO$.

\item To define ``local variants'' of $\GAO$ and $\GLin$, which we denote as $\LAO$ and $\LLin$, respectively.  $\LAO$ and $\LLin$ can be evaluated in
  small subsystems of $(\B, Q_0)$. When either $\LAO$ or $\LLin$ holds in a small subsystem, we confirm deadlock freedom of $(\B, Q_0)$ without
  state-explosion. The local conditions imply the corresponding global ones, \ie they are sufficient but not necessary for deadlock-freedom.

\en
%
We therefore now have four deadlock-freedom conditions: $\GAO$ (global alternating), $\LAO$ (local alternating), $\GLin$ (global linear), and $\LLin$
(local linear). There are all concrete instances of the abstract version of the deadlock-freedom condition given in \secn{abstract-scfree-conditions}.
