\section{Reviewer 1}
This work presents the details of a technique to determine whether a multi-process system
is free from deadlock. In order to avoid the problems of state-explosion in model checking
multi-component systems, the technique is designed to apply first to smaller sub-systems
of the larger system.  Freedom from deadlock in the smaller system implies freedom
from deadlock in the larger system.  If the smaller system is not free from deadlock,
one can expand the model to include more components and perform the check again on
a larger sub-system, until the point where either the system is shown to satisfy deadlock
freedom, the entire system is found not to be deadlock free,  or state explosion prevents
the further application of model checking.


Evaluation: the paper is well motivated and well written; the topic of
avoiding state explosion in model checking multi-component systems
is both interesting and important.

I have a few concerns about the presentation of the results, and about the
comparison with related work sections.  I feel these are relatively minor
questions and that assuming the authors address the questions the paper should
then be accepted for publication.

Detailed comments/questions:
\begin{enumerate}

\item there has been some work on showing how to use CTL-like logics to answer
questions about deadlock freedom.  E.g.
  Computation Tree Logic with Deadlock Detection
  Rob van Glabbeek1,2, Bas Luttik3,4 \& Nikola Trˇcka, that appeared in
  Logical Methods in Computer Science
  Vol. 5 (4:5) 2009, pp. 1–24
Can you comment on the use of those logics in the setting of detecting deadlocks in
BIP?

\item  pg 3, second para from bottom: what does `irrelevant' mean in this context?

\item pg 4, top of page: "we assume that enablement of a port depends only on the
local state of a component" --- I found this a bit confusing, especially as it related
to models of the dining philosophers or token passing models.  More specifically, I
did not follow the reasoning about how one analyzed multi-process systems
where shared variable interaction was critical to showing deadlock behavior.

~

It would be very helpful if in the paper the authors could `work through' the application
of the local reasoning for both a version of the dinning philosophers and a version
of a single token ring like protocol where the processes require the token to make
any progress.

~

 In the dining philosophers or the token passing model, what do the reduced systems
look like? Individual components?  Can you show how the smaller reduced systems
contain sufficient information about the behavior of the larger system to draw conclusions
about the reachable state space?


\item  definition 2.5. pg 5:  local enablement assumption --- for systems that satisfy
this assumption, does that imply freedom from deadlock?   Can you comment on how and where
this definition will be used?  what implications does it have for the systems that satisfy it?

\item  pg. 6 \& 7, application of proposition 2.13 --- detailing how this proposition works
on the dining philosophers model and the token passing model would be very helpful
for understanding the technique.

\item pg 7; def. 3.1 and 3.2 --- definition 3.1 of global deadlock seems straightforward, but
def. 3.2 is not.  A more detailed description of the intuition behind definition 3.1 would
be very useful.  Maybe a small example would help.

\item pg 27, def. 6.11 --- it would be very helpful to provide a bit more
intuition as to what this definition is describing --- in particular it was not
clear to me how to interpret the use of the definition in understanding the
application on page 32..

\item  related work: there has been extensive work on compositional reasoning
technique applied to multi-component systems, both in terms of analyzing
safety properties, and in terms of analyzing ltl and ctl formulae.  Could you comment
on the relationship of that work to this current submission?
