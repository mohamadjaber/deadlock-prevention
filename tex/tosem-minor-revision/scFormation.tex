\subsection{Abstract supercycle freedom conditions}

Since we will present several conditions for supercycle-freedom, we now present an abstract
definition of the essential properties that all such conditions must have.  The key idea is that
execution of an interaction $\act$ does not create a supercycle, and so any condition which implies 
this for $\act$ is sufficient. if a different condition implies the same for another interaction
$\actp$, this presents no problem \wrt establishing deadlock-freedom. Hence, it is sufficient to
have one such condition for each interaction in  $(\B,Q_0)$. Since each condition restricts the
behavior of interaction execution, we call it a ``behavioral restriction condition''.

%Moreover, since implication of $\GAO(\act)$ can be on a ``per interaction'' basis, with different
%conditions being applied to different interactions, we have:


\bd[Behavioral restriction condition]
A \introdf{behavioral restriction condition} $\BC$ is a predicate
$\BC: (\B, Q_0, \act) \to \set{\ttt, \fff}$.
\ed
%
$\BC$ is a predicate on the effects of a particular interaction $\act$ within a given system
$(\B, Q_0)$.

\bd[Supercycle-freedom preserving] \label{def:SC-free-preserving}
A behavioral restriction condition $\BC$ is \introdf{supercycle-freedom preserving} iff, for every system 
$(\B, Q_0)$ and $\act \in \gamma$ such that $\BC(\B, Q_0, \act) = \ttt$, the following holds:\\[2ex]
%
%\ind for all interactions $\act$ of $\B$ (\ie $a \in \gamma$),\\
\ind \ind for every reachable transition $s \goesto[\act] t$ of $(\B, Q_0)$\\

\bpr Let $u$ be an arbitrary reachable state. The proof is by induction on the length of the finite
execution $\al$ that ends in $u$.  Assumption~\ref{theorem:SC-free-preserving.initial} provides the
base case, for $\al$ having length 0, and so $u \in Q_0$.  For the induction step, we establish: for
every reachable transition $s \la{\act} t$, $\wfg{\B}{s}$ is supercycle-free implies that
$\wfg{\B}{t}$ is supercycle-free. This is immediate from
Assumption~\ref{theorem:SC-free-preserving.reachable-transitions}, and
Definition~\ref{def:SC-free-preserving}.  \epr

Since the above proof does not make any use of the requirement that there is a single restriction
$\BC$ for all interactions, we immediately have:

% Hence, we follow outgoing wait-for edges in computing supercycle-membership. Actually, it turns out
% to be easier to compute the negation of supercycle membership, which we call \intro{supercycle
%   violation}. This is because supercycle-violation has a base case: when a node has no outgoing
% wait-for edges. We need a base case, and an inductive definition, because 
% a node that is not in any supercycle may nevertheless be a node of a wait-for cycle, since a cycle
% of wait-for-edges does not necessarily imply a supercycle. Hence, to compute supercycle violation
% properly, we introduce a notion of the \emph{level} of a violation. A node with no
% outgoing wait-for edges has a level-1 violation. A node whose violation is based on outgoing edges
% to neighbors whose violation level is at most $d-1$, has itself a level-$d$ violation. We

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{The supercycle formation condition}

We use the structural properties of supercycles (\secn{supercycle-structural}) and the 
dynamics of wait-for graphs (\prop{wait-for-edge-preservation}) to define a condition that 
must hold whenever a supercycle is created. Negating this condition then implies the absence of
supercycles. 


\bp[Supercycle formation condition] \label{prop:supercycle-formation}
Assume that $s \goesto[\act] t$ is a transition of $(\B, Q_0)$, $\wfg{\B}{s}$ is supercycle-free, and that $\wfg{\B}{t}$
contains a supercycle.  Then, in $\wfg{\B}{t}$, there exists a $\CC$ such that
\bn
\item $\CC$ is a subgraph of $\wfg{\B}{t}$
\item $\CC$ is strongly connected
\item $\CC$ is a supercycle
\item  in $\wfg{\B}{t}$, there is no wait-for edge from a node in $\CC$ to a node outside of $\CC$
\item there exists a component $\B_i \in \cmps{\act}$ such that $\B_i$ is in $\CC$
\en
\ep
%
\bpr
By assumption, there is a supercycle $\SC$ that is a subgraph of $\wfg{\B}{t}$.
By Proposition~\ref{prop:supercycle:contains-mssc}, $\SC$ contains a
subgraph $\CC$ that is strongly connected, is itself a supercycle, and
such that there is no wait-for-edge from a node in $\CC$ to a node outside of $\CC$.
This establishes Clauses~1--4.

Now suppose $\B_i \not\in \CC$ for every $\B_i \in \cmps{\act}$. Then, no edge in $\CC$ is
$\B_i$-incident.  Hence, by Proposition~\ref{prop:wait-for-edge-preservation}, every edge in $\CC$
is an edge in $\wfg{\B}{s}$. Hence $\CC$ is a subgraph of $\wfg{\B}{s}$.
%
Now let $v$ be an arbitrary node in $\CC$.
%
Suppose $v$ is a component $\B_j$.  By assumption, $\B_j \not\in \cmps{\act}$, and so
$s \pj \B_j = t \pj \B_j$ by Definition~\ref{def.bip.composition}. Hence $\B_j$ enables the same set
of interactions in state $s$ as in state $t$. Also, in $\wfg{\B}{t}$, all of $\B_j$'s wait-for edges
must end in an interaction that is in $\CC$, since $\CC$ is a supercycle in $\wfg{\B}{t}$. Hence the
same holds in $\wfg{\B}{s}$.
%
If $v$ is an interaction, it must also have a wait-for-edge $e'$ to some component $\B_j \in \CC$,
since $\CC$ is a supercycle in $\wfg{\B}{t}$. Hence this also holds in $\wfg{\B}{s}$.
%
Hence $v$ has enough successors in $\CC$ to satisfy the supercycle definition (\defn{supercycle}).
%
We conclude that $\CC$ by itself is a supercycle in $\wfg{\B}{s}$, which contradicts the assumption
that $\wfg{\B}{s}$ is supercycle-free. Hence, $\B_i \in \CC$ for some $\B_i \in \cmps{\act}$, and so
Clause~5 is established.  
\epr



%\subsection{Violations of the supercycle formation condition}

\subsection{General supercycle violation condition}

We use \prop{supercycle-formation} to formulate a condition that prevents the formation of
supercycles. 
For transition $s \goesto[\act] t$, we determine for every component $\B_i \in \cmps{\act}$ whether
it is possible for $\B_i$ to be a node in a strongly-connected supercycle $\CC$ in $\wfg{\B}{t}$. 
%If not, then we say that $\B_i$ satisfies the \emph{supercycle violation} condition, and we
%formalize this condition below.
There are two ways for $\B_i$ to not be a node in a strongly-connected supercycle:
\bn
\item \textit{no supercycle membership}: $\B_i$ is not a node of any supercycle, \ie $\neg \scyc{\B}{s}{\B_i}$.

\item \textit{no strong-connectedness}: $\B_i$ is a node in a supercycle, but not a node in a \emph{strongly-connected} supercycle. 

\en

%\subsection{Strong connectedness condition}
% commentary: strong connectedness violation cannot be defined "locally" in a good way, like supercycle violation
% can, since it depends on reachability, which is a global property. For a supercycle, once the set
% of nodes is fixed, the required wait-for relations are all local properties. Hence, violation is
% also a local property. For strong connectedness, the best local property is "no incoming" or "no
% outgoing", which is just the linear condition of the FORTE 2013 paper. Hence a local condition for
% strong connectedness violation is no improvement over FORTE 2013.

%Given that $\B_i$ is a node in a supercycle, we wish to determine whether or not it is a node in a
%\emph{strongly-connected} supercycle. We do this by removing all nodes with supercycle-violations,
%and then finding the maximal strongly connected components of the resulting wait-for subgraph.

We formalize the second condition as follows.

\bd[Strong connectedness violation, $\connViol{v}{t}$]
\label{def:sConn.violation}
 Let $v$ be a node of $\wfg{\B}{t}$.   Then $\connViol{v}{t}$ holds iff there does not exist a 
strongly connected
 supercycle $SSC$ such that $v \in SSC$ and $SSC \sub \wfg{B}{t}$.
\ed






The general supercycle violation condition is then a disjunction of the supercycle violation condition
and the strong connectedness violation conditions.


\bd[General supercycle violation, $\genViol{v}{t}$]
\label{def:formation.violation} 
\label{defn:formation.violation} 
Let $v$ be a node of $\wfg{\B}{t}$.
Then 
$\genViol{v}{t}  \df \scV{v}{t}  \lor \connViol{v}{t}$.
%$\genViol{v}{t}  \df (\exs d \ge 1: \scViol{v}{d}{t}) \lor \connViol{v}{t}$.
\ed
%
Let $s \goesto[\act] t$ be a reachable transition. If, for every $\B_i \in \cmps{\act}$,
$\formViol{v}{t}$ holds, then, as we show below, $s \goesto[\act] t$ does not introduce a
supercycle, \ie if $s$ is supercycle-free, then so is $t$.  However, evaluating this condition over
all global transitions is subject to state explosion, and so we formulate below a ``local'' version
of the general condition, which can be evaluated in ``small subsystems'', and so we often avoid
state-explosion. Hence the advantage of the local versions is that they are usually efficiently
computable, as we show in the sequel.  We also formulate a ``linear'' condition (both global and
local), which is simpler (but ``more incomplete'') than the general condition, and so is easier to
evaluate.

We remark that, as shown above $\scV{v}{t}$ implies that $v$ cannot be in a
supercycle. Hence, $v$ cannot be in a strongly-connected supercycle.  Hence
$\scV{v}{t}$ implies $\connViol{v}{t}$. It is however convenient to state the
formation violation condition in this manner, since we will formulate a local version
for each of $\scV{v}{t}$ and $\connViol{v}{t}$, and the implication does not
necessarily hold for the local versions. 

We therefore now have four deadlock-freedom conditions: global general, local general, 
global linear, and local linear. We therefore define an abstract version of 
the deadlock-freedom condition first.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Overview of the four supercycle-freedom preserving restrictions}

The supercycle formation condition
(Proposition~\ref{prop:supercycle-formation}) tells us that, when a
supercycle $\SC$ is created, some component $\B_i$ that participates
in the interaction $\act$ whose execution created $\SC$, must be a
node of a strongly connected component $\CC$ of $\SC$, and moreover
$\CC$ is itself a supercycle in its own right. In a sense, $CC$ is the
``essential'' part of $\SC$.

Hence, for a BIP system $(\B, Q_0)$, our fundamental condition for the
prevention of supercycles is that for every reachable transition
$s \goesto[\act] t$ resulting from execution of $\act$, every
component $\B_i$ of $\act$ must exhibit a supercycle-violation
(Definition~\ref{def:supercycle.violation}) in state $t$ (the state
resulting from the execution of $a$). For a given BIP system
$(\B, Q_0)$ and interaction $\act$, we denote that condition
$\GAO(\B, Q_0, \act)$, and define it formally below.  This condition
is, in a sense, the ``most general'' condition for supercycle-freedom.

If $\GAO(\B, Q_0, \act)$ holds, and global state $s$ is
supercycle-free, and $s \goesto[\act] t$, then it follows (as we
establish below) that global state $t$ is also supercycle-free.  So,
by requiring (1) that all initial states are supercycle-free, and (2)
that $\GAO(\B, Q_0, \act)$ holds for all interactions
$\act \in \gamma$, we obtain, by straightforward induction on length
of executions, that every reachable state is supercycle-free.

It also follows that any condition which implies $\GAO(\B, Q_0, \act)$ is also sufficient to guarantee  supercycle-freedom, and
hence deadlock-freedom. We exploit this in two ways:
\bn

\item To provide a ``linear'' condition, $\GLin$, that is easier to evaluate than $\GAO$, since it requires only the
evaluation of lengths of wait-for-paths, \ie it does not have the ``alternating'' character of $\GAO$. 

\item To provide ``local variants'' of $\GAO$ and $\GLin$,  which can often be
evaluated in small subsystems of $(\B, Q_0)$, thereby avoiding state-explosion. The local conditions imply the
corresponding global ones, \ie they are sufficient but not necessary for deadlock-freedom.
