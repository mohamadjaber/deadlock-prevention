Proposition~\ref{prop:static:supercycle-is-sufficient} states that the
existence of a supercycle implies a local deadlock: all components in
the supercycle are blocked forever.

Proposition~\ref{prop:static:supercycle-is-necessary} states that the
existence of a supercycle is necessary for a local deadlock to occur:
if a set of components, \emph{considered in isolation}, are blocked,
then there exists a supercycle consisting of exactly those components,
together with the interactions that each component enables.




\subsection{Wait-for graphs}
\label{secn:wait-for-graphs}

The wait-for-graph for a state $s$ is a directed bipartite and-or
graph which contains as nodes the atomic components $\B_1, \ldots,
\B_n$, and all the interactions $\gamma$.  Edges in the wait-for-graph
are from a $\B_i$ to all the interactions that $\B_i$ enables (in $s$),
and from an interaction $a$ to all the components that participate in
$a$ and which do not enable it (in $s$).


\bd[Wait-for-graph  $\wfg{\B}{s}$]
\label{def:static:wait-for-graph} 
\label{defn:static:wait-for-graph} 
Let $\B = \gamma(\B_1,\dots,\B_n)$ be a BIP composite component, and let
$s = \tpl{s_1,\ldots,s_n}$ be an arbitrary state of $\B$.
The {\em wait-for-graph} $\wfg{\B}{s}$ of $s$ is a directed bipartite and-or graph, where
\begin{nlst1}

\item \label{def:static:wait-for-graph:nodes} the nodes of $\wfg{\B}{s}$ are as follows:
%
   \begin{nlst2}
   \item the and-nodes are the atomic components $\B_i$, $i \in \oneton$,
   \item the or-nodes are the interactions $\act \in \gamma$,
% such that for some  $i \in \oneton$: $B_i \in C_a$ and $s_i \enb{a}{B_i}$  OMIT this
   \end{nlst2}

\item \label{def:static:wait-for-graph:edges-aut-action} 
   there is an edge in $\wfg{\B}{s}$ from $\B_i$ to every node 
   $\act$ such that $\B_i \in \cmps{\act}$ and $s_i(\gd{\act}{i}) = \true$, \ie from $\B_i$ to every interaction
   which $\B_i$ enables in $s_i$,

\item  \label{def:static:wait-for-graph:edges-action-aut}
   there is an edge in $\wfg{\B}{s}$ from $a$ to every 
   $\B_i$ such that $\B_i \in \cmps{\act}$ and $s_i(\gd{\act}{i}) = \false$, \ie from $\act$ to every component
   $\B_i$ which participates in $\act$ but does not enable it, in state $s_i$.
                  
\end{nlst1}
\ed

A component $\B_i$ is an and-node since all of its successor actions (or-nodes) must be disabled for
$\B_i$ to be incapable of executing.  An interaction $\act$ is an or-node since it is disabled if
any of its participant components do not enable it.  An edge (path) in a wait-for-graph is called a
wait-for-edge (wait-for-path).  Write $\act \ar \B_i$ ($\B_i \ar \act$ respectively) for a
wait-for-edge from $\act$ to $\B_i$ ($\B_i$ to $\act$ respectively).  We abuse notation by writing
$e \in \wfg{\B}{s}$ to indicate that $e$ (either $\act \ar \B_i$ or $\B_i \ar \act$) is an edge in
$\wfg{\B}{s}$.  Also $\B_i \ar \act \ar \B'_i \in \wfg{\B}{s}$ for
$B_i \ar \act \in \wfg{\B}{s} \land \act \ar B'_i \in \wfg{\B}{s}$, \ie for a wait-for-path of
length 2, and similarly for longer wait-for-paths.

% done in Local Enablement Assumption above
%We assume, in the sequel, that every component $B_i$ always enables at least one interaction, \ie 
%in all reachable states $s$,  $B_i \ar a$ for at least $a$. This prevents pathological situations where a component
%causes a deadlock by disabling every interaction that it participates in.

Consider the dining philosophers system given in Figure~\ref{fig:diningSpectrum}.
Figure~\ref{fig:wfg0} shows its wait-for-graph in its sole initial state.  Figure~\ref{fig:wfg1}
shows the wait-for-graph after execution of $\get_0$.  Edges from components to interactions are
shown solid, and edges from interactions to components are shown dashed.

\begin{figure*}[ht]
  \begin{center}
      \subfigure[Wait-for-graph in initial state.]{\label{fig:wfg0}\scalebox{0.4}{\input{figs/wfgDiningInitial.pdf_t}}} \quad

      \caption{Example wait-for-graphs for dining philosophers system of Figure~\ref{fig:diningSpectrum}.}
       \label{fig:wfg}
  \end{center}
\end{figure*}


A key principle of the dynamics of the change of wait-for graphs is that 
wait-for edges not involving some interaction
$\act$ and its participants $\B_i \in \cmps{\act}$ are unaffected by the execution
of $\act$.  Say that edge $e$ in a wait-for-graph
is \emph{$\B_i$-incident} iff $\B_i$ is one of the endpoints of $e$.


\bp[Wait-for edge preservation] \label{prop:wait-for-edge-preservation}
Let $s \la{\act} t$ be a transition of composite component $B =
\gamma(\B_1,\dots,\B_n)$, and let $e$ be a wait-for edge in $\wfg{\B}{s}$
that is not $\B_i$-incident, for every $\B_i \in \cmps{\act}$. Then $e \in
\wfg{\B}{s}$ iff $e \in \wfg{\B}{t}$. 
\ep
%
\prfs{
Components not involved in the execution of $\act$ do not change state
along $s \la{\act} t$. Hence the endpoint of $e$ that is a
component has the same state in $s$ as in $t$. The proposition then
follows from Definition~\ref{def:static:wait-for-graph}. 
}
%
\prf{
Fix $e$ to be an arbitrary wait-for-edge that is not
$\B_i$-incident. $e$ is either $\B_j \ar b$ or $b \ar \B_j$, for some
component $\B_j$ of $B$ that is not in $\cmps{\act}$, and an interaction $b$
(different from $\act$) that $\B_j$ participates in.
%
Now $s \pj \B_j = t \pj \B_j$, since $s \la{\act} t$ and $\B_j \not\in \cmps{\act}$. Hence $s(\gd{b}{j}) =
t(\gd{b}{j})$. It follows from Definition~\ref{def:static:wait-for-graph} that 
$e \in \wfg{\B}{s}$ iff $e \in \wfg{\B}{t}$.
}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Supercycles and deadlock-freedom}

We characterize a deadlock as the existence in the wait-for-graph of a
graph-theoretic construct that we call a {\em supercycle}.

\bd[Supercycle]
\label{def:supercycle} 
\label{defn:supercycle} 
Let $\B = \gamma(\B_1,\dots,\B_n)$ be a composite component and $s$ be a state of $\B$.
A subgraph $\SC$ of $\wfg{\B}{s}$ is a supercycle in $\wfg{\B}{s}$ if and only if all of the following hold:
\begin{nlst1}
   \item \label{def:supercycle.nonempty} \label{clause:supercycle.nonempty} 
$\SC$ is nonempty, \ie contains at least one node,

   \item \label{def:supercycle.component-blocked} \label{clause:supercycle.component-blocked} 
if $\B_i$ is a node in $\SC$, then for all interactions $\act$ such that
there is an edge in $\wfg{\B}{s}$ from $\B_i$ to $\act$:
      \begin{nlst2}
      \item $\act$ is a node in $\SC$, and 
      \item there is an edge in $\SC$ from $\B_i$ to $\act$,
      \end{nlst2}
that is, $\B_i \ar \act \in \wfg{\B}{s}$ implies $\B_i \ar \act \in \SC$,

   \item \label{def:supercycle.action-blocked}  \label{clause:supercycle.action-blocked}  
if $\act$ is a node in $\SC$, then there exists a $\B_j$ such that:
      \begin{nlst2}
      \item $\B_j$  is a node in $\SC$, and
      \item there is an edge from $\act$ to $\B_j$ in $\wfg{\B}{s}$, and
      \item there is an edge from $\act$ to $\B_j$ in $\SC$,
      \end{nlst2}
that is, $\act \in \SC$ implies $\ex \B_j : \act \ar \B_j \in \wfg{\B}{s} \land \act \ar \B_j \in \SC$,

\end{nlst1}
\ed
where $\act \in SC$ means that $\act$ is a node in $\SC$, etc. 
Also, write $SC \sub \wfg{\B}{s}$ when $\SC$ is a subgraph of $\wfg{\B}{s}$.


\bd[Supercycle-free]
\label{def:supercycle-free}
\label{defn:supercycle-free}
$\wfg{\B}{s}$ is \emph{supercycle-free} iff 
there does not exist a supercycle $\SC$ in $\wfg{\B}{s}$. 
In this case, say that state $s$ is supercycle-free.
Formally, we define the predicate 
    $\scf{B}{s} \df \neg \ex \SC: \SC \sub \wfg{\B}{s} \ \mbox{and $\SC$ is a supercycle}$. 
\ed

\begin{figure*}[ht]
  \begin{center}
   \scalebox{0.4}{\input{figs/wfgDiningCycle.pdf_t}}
   \caption{Example supercycle for dining philosophers system of Figure~\ref{fig:diningSpectrum}.}
   \label{fig:sc}
  \end{center}
\end{figure*}


Figure~\ref{fig:sc} shows an example supercycle (with boldened edges) for the dining philosophers
system of Figure~\ref{fig:diningSpectrum}.
$P_0$ waits for (enables) a single interaction, $\Get_0$. 
$\Get_0$ waits for (is disabled by) fork $F_0$, which waits for interaction $\Rel_0$.
$\Rel_0$ in turn waits for $P_0$. However, this supercycle occurs in a state where $P_0$ is in $h$
and $F_0$ is in $u_l$. This state is not reachable from the initial state. 


Figure~\ref{fig:SCnotCycle} shows an example of a supercycle that is not a simple cycle. 
The ``essential'' part of the supercycle, consisting of components $B_1, B_2,B_3$, and their actions $a,b,c,d$, is boldened. 
The supercycle can be extended to contain $B_4$, but beither $B_5$ nor $B_6$: $B_6$ is enabled, and $B_5$ has is ready to execute $h$, which waits
only for $B_6$.

\caption{Example supercycle that is not a simple cycle}
\label{fig:SCnotCycle}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%
Figure~\ref{fig:cycleOK} shows that deleting the wait-for edge from $d$ to $\B_1$ in Figure~\ref{fig:SCnotCycle}  results in 
an example where there is
a cycle of wait-for-edges, without there being a supercycle. This shows
that a cycle does not necessarily imply a supercycle, and hence
deadlock.

\caption{Example where a wait-for cycle does not imply deadlock}
\label{fig:cycleOK}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


The existence of a supercycle is sufficient and necessary for the occurrence of
a deadlock, and so checking for supercycles gives a sound and complete check for
deadlocks.  
%
Proposition~\ref{prop:static:supercycle-is-sufficient} states that the
existence of a supercycle implies a local deadlock: all components in
the supercycle are blocked forever.

\bp
\label{prop:static:supercycle-is-sufficient}
Let $s$ be a state of $\B$.
If $\SC \sub \wfg{\B}{s}$ is a supercycle, then all components $\B_i$ in $\SC$ cannot execute a transition in any state reachable
from $s$, including $s$ itself.
\ep
%\begin{proof}
\prfs{Every interaction $\act$ that $\B_i$ enables is not enabled by some
participant. By Definition~\ref{def.bip.enablement}, $\act$ cannot be
executed. Hence $\B_i$ cannot execute any transition.
}
%
\prf{
Let $\B_i$ be an arbitrary component in $SC$. By Definition~\ref{def:supercycle}, every interaction that $\B_i$ enables
has a wait-for-edge to some other component $\B_j$ in $\SC$ and so cannot be executed in state $s$. Hence in any
transition from $s$ to another global state $t$, all of the components $\B_i$ in $\SC$ remain in the same local state. 
Hence $\SC \sub \wfg{\B}{t}$, \ie the same supercycle $\SC$ remains in global state $t$. Repeating this argument from state $t$
and onwards leads us to conclude that $\SC \sub \wfg{\B}{u}$ for any state $u$ reachable from $s$.
}%\end{proof}

Proposition~\ref{prop:static:supercycle-is-necessary} states that the
existence of a supercycle is necessary for a local deadlock to occur:
if a set of components, \emph{considered in isolation}, are blocked,
then there exists a supercycle consisting of exactly those components,
together with the interactions that each component enables.
%
\bp
\label{prop:static:supercycle-is-necessary} 
\label{prop:supercycle-is-necessary}
Let $\B'$ be a subcomponent of $\B$, and
let $s$ be an arbitrary state of $\B$ such that $\B'$,
when considered in isolation, has no enabled interaction in state $s \pj \B'$.
%
Then, $\wfg{\B}{s}$ contains a supercycle.
\ep
\prfs{Every atomic component $\B_i$ in $\B'$ is individually deadlock free, by assumption, 
and so there is at least one interaction $a_i$ which
$\B_i$ enables. Now $a_i$ is not enabled in $\B'$, by the antecedent of the proposition. Hence $a_i$ has some
outgoing wait-for-edge in $\wfg{\B}{s}$. The subgraph of $\wfg{\B}{s}$ induced by all
the $\B_i$ and all their (locally) enabled interactions is therefore a supercycle.
}
%
\prf{Let $\B_i$ be an arbitrary atomic component in $\B'$, and let $\act_i$ be any interaction that $\B_i$ enables. Since $\B'$ has no
enabled interaction, it follows that $\act_i$ is not enabled in $\B'$, and
therefore has a wait-for-edge to some atomic component $\B_j$ in
$\B'$. Let $SC$ be the subgraph of $\wfg{\B}{s}$ induced by:
\bn
\item the atomic components of $\B'$, 
\item the interactions $\act$ that each atomic component $\B_i$ enables,
     and the edges $\B_i \ar \act$, and
\item  the edges $\act \ar \B_j$ from each interaction to some atomic
     component $\B_j$ in $\B'$ that does not enable $\B_j$.
\en
$\SC$ satisfies Definition~\ref {def:supercycle} and so is a supercycle.
}

We consider subcomponent $\B'$ in isolation to avoid other phenomena that prevent interactions from executing, \eg
conspiracies \cite{AFG93}.  
Now the converse of Proposition~\ref{prop:supercycle-is-necessary} is that absence of
supercycles in $\wfg{\B}{s}$ means there is no locally deadlocked subsystem. 



\bco[Supercycle-free implies free of local deadlock]
\label{cor:static:dead-free}
%Let $(B,Q_0)$ be a BIP system, with $B = \gamma(\B_1,\dots,\B_n)$. 
If, for every reachable state $s$ of $(\B,Q_0)$, $\wfg{\B}{s}$ is supercycle-free, then
$(\B,Q_0)$ is free of local deadlock.
\eco
%
\prf{
We establish the contrapositive.
Suppose that $(\B, Q_0)$ is not free of local deadlock. Then there exists a subsystem $(\B', Q'_0)$ of $(\B, Q_0)$, and
a reachable state $s$ of $(\B', Q'_0)$, such that $\B'$ enables no interaction in state  $s \pj \B'$.
By Proposition~\ref{prop:supercycle-is-necessary}, $\wfg{\B}{s}$ contains a supercycle.
}

In the sequel, we say ``deadlock-free'' to mean ``free of local deadlock''.



We wish to check whether supercycles can be formed or not.
% \ie whether the supercycle formation condition is satisfied or not.
In principle, we could check directly whether $\wfg{\B}{s}$ contains a supercycle, for each
reachable state $s$. However, this approach is subject to state-explosion, and so is usually
unlikely to be viable in practice.  Instead, we formulate global conditions for supercycle-freedom,
and then ``project'' these conditions onto small subsystems, to obtain local versions of these
conditions that are (1) efficiently checkable, and (2) imply the global versions.
To formulate these conditions, we need to characterize the static (structural) and dynamic
(formation) properties of supercycles.

\subsection{A fixpoint characterization of supercycles}
\label{secn:supercycle-fixpoint}

\bd[Subgraph of a wait-for graph] \label{defn:wsubgraph}
$W$ is a subgraph of $\wfg{\B}{s}$ iff the nodes of $W$ are a subset of the nodes of $\wfg{\B}{s}$ and the edges of $W$ are the induced edges from 
$\wfg{\B}{s}$, \ie if $u,v$ are nodes of $W$ and $u \ar v$ is en edge of $\wfg{\B}{s}$, then $u \ar v$ is en edge of $W$.
Write $W \subg \wfg{\B}{s}$ when $W$ is a subgraph of $\wfg{\B}{s}$, and extend the definition of $\subg$ to subgraphs of $\wfg{\B}{s}$ in the obvious
manner, so that $V \subg W$ means that $V$ is a subgraph of $W$.
\ed

\bd[Set of subgraphs] \label{defn:wsetOfSubgraphs}
$\wfgS{B}{s} = \set{ W \stt W \subg \wfg{B}{s} }$.
\ed


\bd[Wait-for lattice] \label{defn:wflattice}
Define the partially ordered set $\lat{\B}{s} = \tpl{ \wfgS{B}{s}, \subg }$ %\tpl{ \wfg{B}{s}, \ewfg, \subg }$
whose elements are all the subgraphs of 
\wfg{B}{s}, and where  $U \subg V$ is as in \defn{wsubgraph}.   
%iff $U$ is a subgraph of $V$, \ie $\ord$ is the ``is a subgraph of'' order relation.
\ed

The following proposition follows immediately from the definitions; its proof is left to the reader.
\bp \label{prop:isALattice}
$\lat{\B}{s} = \tpl{ \wfgS{B}{s}, \subg }$ is a complete boolean lattice as follows:
\be

\item meet is given by graph intersection: 
$U \meet V$ consists of the nodes that are present in both $U$ and $V$, together with their induced edges

\item join is given by graph union: $U \join V$ consists of the nodes and edges that are present in $U$, or in $V$, or in both, together with their
  induced edges.
 Note that $\join$ is \emph{not} disjoint graph union: 
it is possible for $U$ and $V$ to have nodes and edges in common. Note also that $U \join V$ may contain edges not present in either $U$ nor $V$,
since the edges are those induced by  \wfg{B}{s}. 

\item \wfg{B}{s}  is the top element 

\item  the empty wait-for graph, denoted by \ewfg, is the bottom element

\item the complement of $W$ is \compl{W} obtained by taking all the nodes of $W$  that are not in \wfg{B}{s}, together with the induced edges.
\ee
\ep
As noted, $\join, \meet$ and complement are determined entirely by the sets of nodes in the relevant subgraphs. Theresulting edges are always those
that are induced by \wfg{B}{s}. 



\bd \label{defn:blocks}
Let $U \subg \wfg{B}{s}$ and $a, B_i$ be nodes in $\wfg{B}{s}$. Then 
$\blocks{a}{U} \df (\ex B_i \in U : a \ar B_i \sub \wfg{B}{s})$, and 
$\blocks{B_i}{U} \df (\fa a : B_i \ar a \sub\wfg{B}{s} \imp a \in U \land \blocks{a}{U})$.
\ed

\bd \label{defn:scFix}
Define $\SFs: \wfgS{B}{s} \to \wfgS{B}{s}$ as follows.
$\SF{W}$ is the subgraph with nodes $\set{w \stt \blocks{w}{W} }$, together with their induced edges.
\ed


\bd \label{defn:violFix}
Define $\VFs: \wfgS{B}{s} \to \wfgS{B}{s}$ as follows.
$\VF{W}$ is the subgraph with nodes \compl{\set{w \stt \neg \blocks{w}{W} }}, together with their induced edges.
\ed

\bp \label{prop:monotone}
$\SFs$ and $\VFs$ are monotone.
\ep
Hence, by the Knaster-Tarski theorem, the least and greatest fixpoints of $\SF{}$ and $\VF{}$ exist.
%, and so their greatest and least fixpoints 

\bp \label{prop:supercycleGFP}
Let $W \subg \wfg{B}{s}$. Then $W$ is a supercycle in \wfg{B}{s} iff $W \subg \SF{W}$.
\ep
%
\begin{proof}
Since $\SF{U} \ord U$ by \defn{scFix}, we have $U = \SF{U}$. Hence, ...
\end{proof}

Thus the supercycles of \wfg{B}{s} are exactly the post-fixpoints of $\SFs$. This implies that the union of two supercycles is also a supercycle. 

\bp \label{prop:GFPisLargestSC}
Let $W$ be the greatest fixpoint of $\SFs$. Then either
(a) \wfg{B}{s} is supercycle-free and $W = \ewfg$, or 
(b) \wfg{B}{s} contains supercycles, and $W$ is the largest supercycle in \wfg{B}{s}
\ep
%
\begin{proof}
By Knaster-Tarski, the greaterst fixpoint is the join of all the post-fixpoints. 
If \wfg{B}{s} is supercycle-free, then by \prop{supercycleGFP}, the set of post-fixpoints of $\SFs$ is empty. 
Hence $W = \ewfg$.
If \wfg{B}{s} contains supercycles, , then by \prop{supercycleGFP},  the set of post-fixpoints of $\SFs$ is exactly the set of 
supercycles of \wfg{B}{s}, and so $W$ is the union of all these supercycles, and so $W$ is the largest supercycle in \wfg{B}{s}.
\end{proof}


\bp \label{prop:LFGisScViolations}
Let  $V= \lfp{\VFs}$, \ie $V$ is the least fixpoint of $\VFs$. Then $v \in V$ iff $v$ is not a node in any supercycle of \wfg{B}{s}.    
%the nodes of $V$ are exactly the nodes in \wfg{B}{s} that have supercycle violations. 
\ep
\begin{proof}
%Follows from \prop{GFPisLargestSC} are the Park conjugate (dual) fixpoint theorem in complete boolean lattices.
From the Park conjugate (dual) fixpoint theorem in complete boolean lattices, we have 
\lfp{\VFs} = \compl{\gfp{\SFs}}.
By \prop{GFPisLargestSC} , \gfp{\SFs} is the largest supercycle in \wfg{B}{s}. Hence the nodes not in 
\gfp{\SFs} are exactly the nodes that have supercycle violations. These are exactly the nodes in \lfp{\VFs}.
\end{proof}


\bp \label{prop:computeLFP}
$\lfp{\VFs} = \join_{d \ge 0} \VFs^{d} (\ewfg)$.
\ep
\begin{proof}
$\VFs$ is monotone and $\lat{\B}{s}$ is finite. Hence $\VFs$ is continuous. Follows by standard results, \eg see the CPO fixpoint theorem I in 
\cite{DP02}.
\end{proof}



\bd[Supercycle violation, $\scV{v}{s}$, $\scVd{v}{d}{s}$]
\label{def:supercycle-violation}
\label{def:supercycle.violation}
\label{defn:supercycle.violation}
$\scV{v}{s} \df v \in \lfp{\VFs}$ and 
$\scVd{v}{d}{s} \df v \in \VFs^{d} (\ewfg)$.
\ed

It follows from \prop{LFGisScViolations} that $\scV{v}{s}$ iff there does not exist $\SC$ such that $\SC$ is a supercycle and $v \in SC$.

We say that a node $v$ of \wfg{B}{s} has a \emph{supercycle violation}\footnote{In the sequel, we say sc-violation rather than ``supercycle violation.''} iff $v$ is not a node in any supercycle of \wfg{B}{s}, 
\ie iff $\scV{v}{s}$ holds. 
By \prop{computeLFP}, we can compute $\lfp{\VFs}$ (and therefore $\scV{v}{s}$) by iterating $\VFs$, starting from $\ewfg$, until there is no more change.

%In the sequel, we say sc-violation rather than ``supercycle violation.''  The crucial result is
%that, if $v$ has a level-$d$ sc-violation, for some $d \ge 1$, then $v$ cannot be a node of a
%supercycle.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Structural properties of supercycles}
\label{secn:supercycle-structural}

We present some structural properties of supercycles, which
are central to our deadlock-freedom conditions.


\bd[Path, path length] \label{def:path} \label{defn:path}
Let $G$ be a directed graph and $v$ a vertex in $G$. A path $\pi$ in $G$ is a \emph{finite} sequence

number of edges in $\pi$

$|\pi| = \omega$ ($\omega$ for ``infinity'').

Let $G$ be a directed graph and $v$ a vertex in $G$. Define the in-depth of $v$ in $G$, notated as
$\idepth{G}{v}$, as follows:
\be
\item if there exists a path $\pi$ in $G$ that contains a cycle and ends in $v$, \ie $|\pi| = \omega
  \land \last{\pi} = v$, then $\idepth{G}{v} = \omega$,
%THIS DEFINITION OF INFINITE IN-DEGREEE IS STRANGE, SINCE YOU HAVE ``INFINITE' PATHS THAT NEVERTHELESS END IN A NODE!

\item otherwise, let $\pi$ be a longest (simple) path ending in $v$. Then $\idepth{G}{v} = |\pi|$.
\ee
Formally, $\idepth{G}{v} = (\MAX\ \pi : \pth{G}{\pi} \land \last{\pi} = v : |\pi|)$.

Likewise define the out-depth of $v$ in $G$, notated as
$\odepth{G}{v}$, as follows:
\be
\item if there exists a path $\pi$ in $G$ that contains a cycle and starts in $v$, \ie $|\pi| = \omega

By Definition~\ref{def:supercycle}, $\SC$ is nonempty, and so contains at least one node $v$.

$\act \ar \B_i$. 
If $v$ is a  component $\B_i$, then, by assumption, $\B_i$ enables at least one interaction $\act$, and by

$w \in \SC'$, by definition of $SC'$.  Furthermore, $w$ is a successor of $v$ in $\SC'$, since $SC'$ consists of

Every supercycle $\SC$ contains a maximal strongly connected component $\CC$

\ep
%
\prf{
$\SC$ is a directed graph, and so consider the decomposition of $\SC$
into its maximal strongly connected components (MSCC). Let $\overline{\SC}$ be the graph resulting
from replacing each MSCC by a single node. By its construction,  $\overline{\SC}$ is acyclic, and so contains at least one
node $x$ with no outgoing edges. Let $\CC$ be the MSCC corresponding to $x$. It follows that $\CC$ is nonempty, and
hence $\CC$ satisfies clause (1) of the supercycle definition~(\ref{def:supercycle}).
It also follows from the construction of $\CC$ that no node in $\CC$ has a wait-for-edge going to a node outside of
$\CC$, and so Clause (2) of the Proposition is established.

Let $v$ be an arbitrary node in $\CC$. Since $\CC \sub \SC$, $v$ is a node of $\SC$. Let $w$ be an arbitrary successor of
$v$ in $\SC$. Since no node in $\CC$ has an edge going to a node outside of $\CC$, it follows that $w$ is a node of $\CC$.
Hence $v$ has the same successors in $\CC$ as in $\SC$. 
Now since $\SC$ is a supercycle, every vertex $v$ in $\SC$ has enough successors in $\SC$ to satisfy clauses (2) and (3)
of the supercycle definition~(\ref{def:supercycle}). It follows that every vertex $v$ in $\CC$ has enough successors in
$\CC$ to satisfy clauses (2) and (3) of the supercycle definition~(\ref{def:supercycle}).  

Hence, by Definition~\ref{def:supercycle}, $\CC$ is itself a supercycle, and so Clause (1) of the Proposition is established.

Note also that by Proposition~\ref{prop:supercycle:contains-twoNodes}, $\CC$ contains at least two nodes. Hence $\CC$ is
not a trivial strongly connected component.
